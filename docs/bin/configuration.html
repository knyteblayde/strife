<h3 class="link">Custom Domain names</h3>
<p>
	custom domain names are the way of naming your application like it is actually a live website,<br>
	for example, in your local development server you are used to be developing on a URL like <code>http://localhost/myproject/index.php</code> but when we use a custom domain name, we can do it like so <code>http://website.dev</code> or <code>http://website.com</code> or any URL that you would want to have for your application. <br>
	custom domains aren't just to fancify our URL but it also solves the directory issues that is encountered in procedural programming,
	you'll see the purpose of these configurations later on. but for now, let's proceed.
</p>

<p>
	We will start to configure our <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file, 
	<br>

	for Xampp, navigate to <code>C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf</code> and for Wampserver, <code>C:\wampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf</code> (please note that my installation directory might be different to yours)
	open the file using any text editor, and add this line of code at the end of the file:<br>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code><span class="kwd">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;</span>
    DocumentRoot <span class="pun">"C:/xampp/htdocs/spiral/public"</span>
    ServerName <span class="pun">myapp.dev</span>
<span class='kwd'>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</span></code></pre>

	Notice the <code>"C:/xampp/htdocs/spiral/public"</code>, this should be the directory where you extracted/installed the Spiral Framework. <br>
	while <code>myapp.dev</code>will be our custom domain name for this purpose, but feel free to change that to whatever you like.<br>

</p>
Now save and exit, let us now configure <code>hosts</code> file<br>
Open your Notepad with administrator privilleges(run as administrator) and open
<code>C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</code>
and add this line at the end:
<pre class='prettyprint'>
<code><span class="pun">127.0.0.1 &nbspmyapp.dev</span></code>
</pre>
If you followed all the above steps, you will now be able to visit <code>http://myapp.dev</code> in your web browser.
